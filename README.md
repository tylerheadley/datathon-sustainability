# The Price of Uncertainty: Analyzing the Impact of Weather Forecast Inaccuracy on Energy Grid Imbalance

## 5C Datathon Competition 2025

**Korin Aldam-Tajima, Liam Graham, Tyler Headley, Julian Piedrahita**

We received 1st place and a $1200 award for our submission to the 5C Datathon. Our report develops a SARIMAX time series forecasting model to show the statistical significance of inaccuracies in various elements of weather forecasts on energy grid imbalance. We were very rushed at the end and only had one weekend to work on this, so our code is very messy lol.
